However, the first CNN model used for computer vision task was developed in 1998 by Yann LeCun's group which was used for **digit classification** (This dataset was called **MNIST** and it became the hello world problem of computer vision). The reason for this success to be truely realized only in 2012 was because of key advents in computational speed with the arrival of GPUs. Another reason was the availablity of large labelled datasets. \n",
